<h2>About Me</h2> 
<h1>Alexandria Ramos</h1>
<p>I am Alexandria Ramos, a student in CIS 162. I am new to CS and I am very much interested in learning about HTML & Java Script. For past experience, I referenced my experience when I worked for a start up tech company and I would test our products. Our team would create softwares, mobile apps and websites for our customers. I am excited to have the opportunity to learn learn as I can from this class. Thank you </p>

<p> My favorite web site is<a href="http://google.com"></a> because it is not just an email provider, map or search engine. It's a place that has evovled where I can store my favorite memories with the cloud connected to my devices. A shopping assistant. A place not only will my questionns be answered but many resources become available. </p>
